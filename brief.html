            <h1>Brief History</h1>
            <br>
            <p>Spain settled Mactan Island around the sixteenth century. The town of Opon was founded by Augustinian
                friars in 1730, and it was incorporated as a city in 1961. The island's chieftain, Datu Lapulapu, was
                the inspiration behind the renaming of the area. In the Battle of Mactan, which took place in 1521 and
                is remembered at the Mactan Shrine in Barangay Mactan, Ferdinand Magellan led a landing party of forty
                men to resupply, but they were ambushed by 1,500 locals, killing their captain and a few other men.

                A military government was established during the Filipino-American War, and on July 17, 1901, the United
                States government reinstated military rule over the province due to the Cebu people's persistent
                resistance. In 1905, Opon held its first municipal election, with Pascual dela Serna winning the
                position of town president.

                Due to the existence of large oil storage tanks in Opon, the town became the target of Japanese raids
                one week after World War II broke out in December 1941. Of the approximately fourteen oil storage tanks
                at Opon, the enemy aircraft managed to blow up two of them. On April 10, 1942, a Japanese Imperial
                Forces unit from the Kawaguchi Detachment made landfall on Cebu's east coast. Subsequently, Harry Fenton
                of the Cebu Resistance Movement's northern unit and Colonel James M. Cushing of the movement's center
                and southern troops formed the resistance movement.
